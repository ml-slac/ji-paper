\abstract{Building on the notion of a particle physics detector as a camera and the collimated streams of high energy particles it measures as an image, we investigate the potential of machine learning techniques based on deep learning architectures.  Modern deep learning algorithms trained on {\it jet images} can out-perform standard physically-motivated feature driven approaches to jet tagging.  We develop techniques for visualizing where these features are learned by the network and what additional information is used to improve performance. This feedback loop between physically-motivated feature driven tools and unsupervised learning algorithms is general and can be used to significantly increase the sensitivity to discover new particles and new forces.}

\section{Introduction}

The fundamental challenge at the energy frontier of particle physics is identifying subtle signals beneath enormous backgrounds. A monumental triumph was the recent discovery of the Higgs boson - a particle that is produced one in every $10^{10}$ collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Machine learning techniques have played a key role in all aspects of this search.  At the most basic level, charged particle tracks are reconstructed using pattern recognition techniques, higher level objects, blah blah. 

Techniques built on physically motivated features have succesfully probed the highest energies and smallest scales ever achieved in terestrial experiments.  At the same time, there have been significant gains

Something like ``we have figured out many cool variables" "machine learning can find variables"  "lets use one to inform/improve the other!''

Let's keep a running document with all pub-ready plots in here.


We can even use this later on when we actually write the paper -- this hosting allows templates, styles, etc. and we can all edit, which is great.

If you guys have any tips on plotting style, let's keep that here too -- as I make graphics now, I want them to be pub ready. You definitely know what reviewers go for more than I do.
