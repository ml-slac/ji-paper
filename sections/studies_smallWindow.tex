\subsection{Studies in the Highly Restricted Phase Space} % (fold)
\label{sub:small_window_studies}

Removing the discrimination power of $\tau_{21}$ and the jet mass in Sec.~\ref{sub:flat_hypercube_studies} allowed us to quantify the unique discrimination power learned by the neural networks.  However, it does not tell us what information is learned.  Another way to quantify the unique information learned by the network that also provides useful information about physical information learned by the network is to restrict the considered phase space such that $\tau_{21}$ and the jet mass distributions do not vary appreciably over the redacted space.  Figure~\ref{fig:meanImagesWindow} shows the average signal and background jet image in three small windows of $\tau_{21}$, the jet mass, and the jet $p_T$.  In all three windows, the jet mass is restricted to be between 79 GeV and 81 GeV and the jet $p_T$ is required to be in the interval [250,260] GeV.  The three windows are then defined by their value of $\tau_{21}$: [0.19,0.21] in the most two-prong-like case, [0.39,0.41] in a region with likelihood ratio near unity and [0.59,0.61] in a mostly one-prong-like case.  The key physics features of the jets falling in these windows are easily visualized from the average jet images.  The most striking observation is that in these three windows, signal jets look very similar to background jets.  When $\tau_{21}\in[0.19,0.21]$, both signal and background jets have a second subjet that is distinct from the leading subjet and this is washed out as the value of $\tau_{21}$ increases.  

The differences between images in these small windows tells us about what information {\it could be learned} by the networks beyond $\tau_{21}$ and the jet mass.  Since the differences are subtle, the average difference is explicitly computed and plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:meanImagesWindow2} for the three narrow windows of $\tau_{21}$.  In the window with $\tau_{21}\in$[0.19,0.21], there are five features: a localized blue patch in the bottom center, a localized red patch just above that, a red diffuse region between the red patch and the center and then a blue dot just left of center surrounded by a red shell to the right.  Each of these have a physics meaning: the lower two localized patches give information about the orientation of the second subjet ($\Delta R$) which is slightly wider for the QCD jets which need a slightly wider angle to satisfy the mass requirement.  The red diffuse region just above the localized patches is likely an indication of colorflow: the $W$ bosons are color singlets compared to the color octet gluon jet background, and thus we expect the radiation pattern to be mostly between the two subjets for the $W$.  There is a similar story for all the features in each of the plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:meanImagesWindow2}.

Now, we turn back to the neutral network and their performance in these small windows of jet mass and $\tau_{21}$.    Figure~\ref{fig:rocWindow} shows three ROC curves in the window $\tau_{21} \in$[0.19,0.21].  By construction, the $\tau_{21}$ curve is no better than a random guess, since this variable does not significantly vary over the small window.  The other two curves are a Fisher Linear Discriminant\footnote{There is no $\Delta R$ binning as in the Fisher Jets of Ref.~\cite{Cogan:2014oua}, but this will make little difference since the $\Delta R$ distribution does not significantly compared with the coarse $\Delta R$ bins within the small mass and $p_T$ windows.} (FLD) trained {\it inside the window} and the convolutional neural network using the energy as pixel intensity and normalized images trained {\it outside the window}.  As in the previous section, this allows us to quantify the unique information in the neural network.   One way to {\it visualize} the unique information is to look at the per-pixel correlation between the intensity and neural network output (Fig.~\ref{fig:corrWindow}).  The physical interpretation of the red and blue areas in Fig.~\ref{fig:corrWindow} are related to the colorflow of $W$ and background jets.  The area in-between the subjets should have more radiation than the area around and outside of the subjets for $W$ jets and vice-versa for QCD jets.  While Fig.~\ref{fig:corrWindow} is not directly the discriminant used in the network and only represents linear correlations with the network output, it does show non-linear spatial information and gives a sense of where in the image the network is looking for discriminating features.

%The fisher jet in Fig.~\ref{fig:fldWindow} is used in the FLD by taking the inner-product with a given jet, treating each image as an $n\times n$ vector.  Positive structures will give a bigger output value for signal jets and negative structures will give a bigger output value for background jets.
