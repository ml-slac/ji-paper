Though we see performance improvements using a deep network under an induced flat hypercube, we want to be sure that these performance improvements are valid and carry over to a less contrived distribution. In particular, we consider a mass window of [79, 81] GeV, a $p_T$ window of [250, 255] GeV, and we require $\tau_21$ to be in [0.19, 0.21]. In Figure~\ref{fig:meanImagesWindow}, we see the differences between signal and background for such a window.




In this window, we compare the DNN trained outside the window to a Fisher Linear Discriminant trained inside the window. In Figure~\ref{fig:rocWindow} we see this performance comparison, and note that our DNN outperforms the FLD.

%In Figure~\ref{fig:convkernelsWindow}, we show the same feature representations as in Figure~\ref{subfig:convolvedfilters}, which show the convolved differences in images over signal and background in the window.
