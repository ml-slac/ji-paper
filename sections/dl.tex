Automatic feature extraction and high-level learned feature representations via deep learning have led to state-of-the-art performance in Computer Vision ~\cite{vggnet} \cite{maxout:goodfellow} \cite{dropout:and:LRN}. As it relates to our work, do not investigate large network architectures, rather we focus on  understanding what information and higher level representations a convolutional neural network will learn in the context of High Energy Physics. We let our knowledge of physics guide our investigations into visualization, understanding, and demystification of deep representations for physics. We shed light inside the black-box of deep learning in the context of object identification in HEP.
